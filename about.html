<p>I am a keen software tester having spent better part of my youth in building test frameworks, desiging test strategies and learning a lot of languages.</p>

<p>It had been fun seeing software development from iterative models to being agile and how software testing practices had to mould themselves to fit the bill.</p>

<p>Some of the great learnings in the recent times had been CI / CD, contextual test strategy design and DevOps. Hoping to do some Performance Testing and Security Testing in the near future.</p>

I presented at Next Generation Testing Conference in Hyderabad on “Testing Infrastructure Automation”.

I started with explaining audience the need for treating Infrastructure As Code (explaining some of the disadvantages with traditional infrastructure automation) and then gave an overview of the Configuration Management Frameworks like Puppet, Chef. After this, I explained the need for testing Infrastructure code and how one should go about doing that. Following this was a demo of building mysql component that could work with two platforms CentOS 6.4 and Ubuntu 12.0.4 in a Test First Approach. The demo consisted of five stages progressively building the component. Please find the slide-deck uploaded [here](http://www.slideshare.net/sreedevivedula/testing-infra-automation).

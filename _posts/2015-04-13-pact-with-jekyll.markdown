After spending some months on wordpress, I have decided to go... neither "pro" nor "geek"... just free from ads. After hearing from some colleagues that they are being shown irrelevant and some times disturbing ads, I decided to move away from wordpress. How ever, I gave a serious thought whether I would like to be geeky even while writing a blog. After a brief trial, jekyll did not seem too bad. Of course, there is some learning curve and I have not yet grown comfortable with it yet. But, I think I made a decision to go this route for now. The next step is to host this blog on my domain... which should  take some time given my pace of working. :).
